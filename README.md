# System-Analysis-and-Design

•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client Liam owner of DriverPass wants to create a system where the customer can check their online test progress, the user’s information, driver notes, make reservations for lessons, and make appointments. This system needs to be accessible online and the owner wants to be able to download file makes changes and reload them to the system.

•	What did you do particularly well?

I think I did well make the UML activity diagrams, the use case I choose for the diagrams were accessing the user’s information and accessing the user’s online test progress. These diagrams are very helpful during the development of the product and are easy to understand.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one part of my work to revise it would be the objectives and goals section, I feel I could have formatted it better and explained more of what the customer wanted. I would write out the customers wants on paper then break it down into sections like security and how it should operate. 

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpret the user’s needs through the initial interview where the owner told the product owner and Scum master what they want the system to do. I wrote on the requirements down and because the owner want to access the system from anywhere and use Microsoft excel to create their files, I choose a Microsoft sever. It is important to consider the user’s needs when designing because the user is the customer and if the customer can’t use the system do to it now having what they need or is to hard to use the system is not worth anything to the client.

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach to the design of the software was to look at what the client wanted in this case the owner already had a design in mind. The techniques I would use in the future would be getting all the clients wants for the system during the initial interview and if the customer has any designs in mind get those as well. During the planning phase of the products lifecycle, I would make plan out the design and write down what needs to be created and if I have questions ask the team. I feel the best techniques in development are using your team, clients wants, and the customers wants to create what they want using the information gained from interacting with them during meeting and discussions.
